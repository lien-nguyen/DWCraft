Chapter 6: Documentation with Sphinx
====================================
- Installed Sphinx and initialized documentation in the root-level `docs/` folder.
- Added `.gitignore` rules to exclude Sphinx build artifacts.
- Created `index.rst`, `setup.rst`, and this `book.rst` to organize project documentation.
