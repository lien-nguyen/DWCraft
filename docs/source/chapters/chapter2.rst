Chapter 2: Docker & Django Setup
=================================
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to build and run Django with PostgreSQL.
- Ensured all project files and apps (`core`, `blog`, `course`, `users`) are inside the main project folder.
- Fixed issues with Docker context, volume mapping, and environment variables.
